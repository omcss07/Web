                <h3> Mision </h3>
                    <p class="p-body">
                        Our mission is to provide a platform where people can share news, and express their opinions freely and responsibly. Through reflection on the impact of technology, we aim to educate society on crucial issues such as artificial intelligence dependence, ensuring that individuals are informed and engaged in shaping a future where technology serves humanity without undermining essential human skills.

                <h3> Vision </h3>
                    <p class="p-body">
                        Our vision is to foster a more informed and critically engaged society, where individuals and communities can navigate the complexities of technological advancements responsibly. By exploring the potential consequences of technology in areas like justice, human behavior, and social change, we seek to shape a future where technological solutions are used to address societal issues equitably, while maintaining ethical standards and protecting human dignity.

                <h3> Method </h3>
                    <p class="p-body">
                        The method involves a multidimensional approach that combines user-generated content, technological analysis, and educational resources. Users will be able to share their insights on the societal impact of technology, while a censorship system ensures respectful and accurate discourse. In addition, in-depth research on topics such as AI, justice systems, and historical behaviors will be presented, with an emphasis on comparison between past and present technological revolutions, exploring how public policy and education can help mitigate negative effects.
